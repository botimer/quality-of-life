# Quality of Life Grab Bag

This is a small collection of quality of life utilities/scripts/notes. They may
be well-formed or misguided, but they seemed useful enough at some point for me
to want to put them in safe keeping.

This might get some organization and become a dotfiles sort of thing, but for
now, it's just a grab bag.
